Dear George,

 

I hope you are well. I thought you may be interested in flick’s new Wellbeing suite of e-learning courses (see below) designed to support you and your colleagues in these stressful times.

These courses covering mental health awareness, stress, handling conflict, mindfulness, listening skills and more, are available either:

 

·        As part of the flick subscription to over 80+ compliance-related e-learning courses – offered on a monthly or annual basis (think Netflix!) See the full list of courses you can access here.

·        To license and host on your own learning management system for just £950 ex vat – with unlimited access
