Hi George,

 

Hope you’re well and business is good.

 

I’m aware we are paying £40 a month to keep hold of our data with you but targeting leads through SalesNav isn’t on our current Marketing plan, therefore we have decided there is no longer a need for you to continue holding the data.

 

If anything changes later down the line and we want to start again, I will be in touch.

 

Thanks George.

 

Best wishes

Hi George,

 

No worries, we will cover the £40. Hoping to be in a position to make a decision in January so I will be in touch then.

 

If I don’t speak to you before, wishing you and your family a lovely Christmas.

 

Best wishes

Hi Jodie,


No GDPR issue.  It’s just that it costs me £40 per month to hold the data on the server that the software is currently running on.  So if I have to de-commission the server (it’s a Microsoft server) then I will lose the data.  Would you be able to cover that cost in the meantime?


Cheers

Hi George,

 

I definitely don’t want to lose all the tracking on what we’ve done to date. It would be good to pick up where we left of.

 

How does it work with keeping the info? Are you asking form a GDPR point of view or is there a cost implication here?

 

Best wishes

 

Jodie

Hi Jodie,


I’ll send you an example of the report but it’s still a little rough around the edges.

 

Just one thing though.  Everything we’ve done to date has been tracked in a database, this is so that the software knows what to do each day.  Without it, we wouldn’t be able to start up again at a future point because it would attempt to connect with people we’ve already connected with, spoke to etc. 

Are you ok for me to keep the database in the meanwhile?


Cheers

George

Hi,

 

I think it will be later than January. Can we cancel the invoicing and then pick it up again when I’m clearer on our focus? Is it a monthly invoice we pay, so easy to begin again when we’re ready?

 

Would really like to see an example of the report when it’s available too.

 

Best wishes

Yes, we are making a major update to the software that will send daily/weekly reports/stats.  It’s a few weeks off as we are still testing it.

 

What you can do and I recommend it to my clients around this time of year.  Is to collect / invite prospects but leave the messaging off until Jan.  This means that when your ready to go in Jan.  You already have batch of people that you can follow up with.  Nothing is wasted and it allows you “hit the ground running” come Jan.


Cheers

George

Hi,

 

We are different to a recruitment company but thanks for the stats, it’s good to know industry standards.

 

Is there a report that is due to be sent? I remember you said there was something coming over.

 

Just wondering what our options are if we don’t have any data atm. Can we pause until I can get a plan and then pick up again next year?

 

Best wishes

 

Jodie

It differs from company to company.  Across the board, I usually expect ¼ that will connect.  But recruitment companies have a slightly lower ratio, around 1/5 which is about right for your stats.
