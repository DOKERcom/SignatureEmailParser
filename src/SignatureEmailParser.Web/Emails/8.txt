Good afternoon,
 
I just wanted to get in touch to see if you were open to new opportunities at the moment? 
 
I specialise within all things ‘Software Development’ and have a number of roles, mainly focused around the Microsoft Tech Stack, all of which offer full remote work for growing businesses. 
 
One business I’m working with in particular are on the lookout for a Senior Software Engineer AND Tech Lead to join their growing global IT teams. They are a well-established software business who operate across the UK, Europe and Africa and work with some of the biggest companies across a variety of sectors. As they work to client requirements, they have a large tech stack utilising all the latest technologies giving you the chance to increase skillset in new areas whilst focusing on familiar tech. They are based in Reading, but this role offers full remote working, although if you were relatively close by then potentially once a month would be required. Both roles are for UK based candidates only.
