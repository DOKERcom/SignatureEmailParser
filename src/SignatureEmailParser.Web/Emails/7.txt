Yes it would but only outside. Let me look into it. I’m glad I emailed!

Thanks for the update on this Luke.

I will add, that the Gloucester Chapel has been the target of criminal behaviour in the recent past - it was broken into during lockdown and significant damage caused, with an attempt to get into the safe.

With the comments from Bishop regarding the possibility of a further attempt to illegally access the building - would this not be a justifiable reason for CCTV, in the circumstances. 

Regards,
Aaron

Thanks for looking into Luke.  It wasn’t so much an issue with crime but rather the inability for me as a Bishop to effectively fulfil my calling to “to care for the meeting house” since persons are going in and out, leaving doors open, lights on etc and I only find out when other members call me.  A member was present when she saw a contractor come in to do some work and leave the doors open when leaving.
 
Incidentally, my ward clerk found this this outside by the foyer near a window that appears someone tried to pry open.

Thanks for looking into it though.

Dear President and Bishop, 
 
I just wanted to drop you a line on the request for a CCTV system in the Gloucester chapel. 
 
Its taken a while but I have finally received a firm answer that I am unable to do it as there is no crimes being committed. 
 
If you want to fit something simple yourselves then I’m not going to stop you. 
 
Thanks,
Luke
