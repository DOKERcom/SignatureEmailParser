GMS Capital-A brief introduction

 

My name is Graham and and I am the owner of GMS Capital, my job is to source funding for businesses looking to secure business finance for working capital,expansion

marketing costs, acquisitions ,indeed any area of business funding, I have access to the whole of the market dealing with direct lenders and specialist brokers,

I will work on your behalf to find the funding you need for your business and will not charge you for my services, if successful I will be paid a commission from the lender.

On business funding the most popular for obvious reasons is unsecured business loans and typically a £20.000 loan would cost around £70a day or £480 a week to repay over 12 months,

I can give you an instant phone quote and get a decision the same day and if accepted funded the following day.

The best form of finance is secured, it could be secured against property, plant and machinery, your debtor book and even stock, once we engage together I will work on your behalf

to get you what you need at the best rate, unsecured or secured.Our latest product available without a personal guarantee is a REVOLVING CREDIT FACILTY, in brief it’s

a cash facility to drawdown between 250k and 5 million secured only against your debtor book and can be put in place in only 10 days

 

So if you are looking for funding now or are likely to in the future please call me 9am to 9pm 7 days a week
