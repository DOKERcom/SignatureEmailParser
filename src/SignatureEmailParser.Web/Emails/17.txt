Hi Harriet,

If Kevin ever want's to have another stab at this in the future our app is now available as a download.  Same app I used for you internally.

https://YOURDOMAIN.com/

The app as all of LinkedIn's data built into it (a new feature).  Wouldn't be worth using LinkedIn Navigator if you have access to this app and all of LinkedIn's data.  Plus, it's cheaper than LI Navigator ðŸ™‚

Cheers
George
