Hi Tim,

Yes, been switched of since your last email.  You may see some people accepting invites that were sent prior to switching it off but this doesn't mean it's still running.

Do you want me to delete your account completely, should I presume you won't be using this service again in the future?

Thanks
George

Hi Tim,

 

That's everything I need.  Just one last thing.   Need the login / password to the LinkedIn account we plan to use for this.  Presumably yours?

 

Cheers

Hi….. Thanks for connecting. Yes, I’m afraid this is one of those messages that tells you all about what my company does! In this case, it’s all about learning and apprenticeships. During the recent National Apprenticeship Week 2022 it became clear that hiring talent is high on may organisations agenda this year. This could be through an early careers approach, a graduate scheme or attracting diverse talent across the board through targeted recruitment. Davies Learning Solutions has a solution to all of the above whilst maximising your apprenticeship levy to deliver technical training.

 

If recruiting top talent is on your radar for this year, please fell free to book in a catch up via the link below or message me back where I can then detail how we can support your strategy, with no cost to your organisation. Thanks, Tim https://calendly.com/tim-scales-apprenticeships
