Hi George,

Sorry for the slow reply, we've been out at an event in Edinburgh.

Hope you are well?

Hannah has gone and we have Silvia covering in the interim while we rehire. We are always looking to keep growing.

What's best for you? Would an intro call with Silvia help to start things up again?

Cheers,

John
