Hi George,

I've recently had a job come in that may be of interest - if it is, please respond to this email with a CV (it doesn't have to be bang up to date, whatever you have handy is fine) and I'll be in touch.

Controls Engineering Project Manager
6 Month Contract
£50/hr / £400/day
Outside IR35
East Bristol (work from home up to 2 days a week)

You'll be working as part of a panel of 4 project managers, covering automation projects mostly centered around the pharmaceutical sector. This would serve as a good step for someone looking to move into the pharma sector. You'll be involved in project planning, people management, interfacing with customers, financial reporting and some technical document writing.
If you're interested but not sure if you fit the bill, don't worry, send over a CV anyway.

Best Regards,
Simon Dunphy
Huxley Engineering
4th Floor, Redcliff Quay, Redcliff Street, Bristol, BS1 6HU, United Kingdom
