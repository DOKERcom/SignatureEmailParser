Please find attached the first newsletter introducing some of the products, services, events and experiences occurring within the scope of caring for those in need.  We hope that this will be of use as we engage in the work of salvation and exaltation through the four divinely appointed responsibilities.

Please feel free to circulate this newsletter to members in your quorum and organisation.

Thank you,

Jonathan.
